# The Broken Stick
Let there be a stick of length 1. Pick two points uniformly at random along the stick and break the stick at those points. What is the probability of the three resulting pieces being able to form a triangle? In the first part of this post, I will provide my analytical approach to calculate the probability. Then in the second part, I will use Monte Carlo simulation to reach to the answer.
